sylvia yapping place (aka my notes. maybe.)
uhhh i have like systems done right now
i have no idea about ui so fuck it we ball
resource list, requests list. requests list has icons (ofcourse it does)
but do we make it so like. the requests and resources are in uhhhh tabs?
cuz they're both scrollable and big uhhh i dunno :P
anyways when you click on a location, camera zooms in, shows the request, accept or cancel, you know the deal.
i think it should have a cool list of materials needed aswell
what if i made the list for resources in the request panel on the side instead of integrated... yeah that's probably cool
